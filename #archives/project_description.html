<h3>MAIN METHOD: main.py</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
	<li>Communicator: Interact the program through the chatbot. (daemon thread)</li>
	<li>Web App: Interact with the program through the web app. (thread: t_webapp)</li>
	<li>Scheduler: The program will interact with itself using a scheduler at predefined time intervals.
		(thread: t_scheduler, daemon thread)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Instead of using threading.join() to wait until the threads have completed. The main function has a loop which
	runs on t_scheduler.is_alive() since t_scheduler is the only non-daemon thread. Inside the thread, the scheduler
	will perform a check for running sub_threads inside scheduler and sleep for 10 seconds.</p>
<p>If at any point the code exits this loop is because the scheduler thread has ended. Which can only be if
	something in the code has failed or if one of the threads have triggered a planned exit. All planned stops in the
	program is controlled by "stop_all" global variable. If the "stop_all" is not enabled the program will
	automatically reboot itself after a minute. If the "stop_all" global variable is enabled then it will proceed to
	exit the program or perform the necessary operations defined by the variables in the global variables</p>




<h3>GLOBAL VARIABLES: global_var.py</h3>
<p>This files contains all the global variables which need to be accessed across threads.</p>
<ul>
	<li>ready_to_run - Signals for the Communicator to run after all objects have been initialized as certain
		commands from the communication module can be waiting before the program is initialized.</li>
	<li>stop_all - Signals for all threads that a program stop has been requested.</li>
	<li>restart - Signals the main thread that a reboot of the program is requested. This must be coupled with a
		stop_all to ensure that the program stops before the reboot can happen.</li>
	<li>reboot_pi - Signals the main thread that a reboot of the Raspberry pi is requested. This must be coupled with a
		stop_all to ensure that the program stops before the reboot can happen.</li>
	<li>check_shows - Signal the Scheduler to run Show Downloader</li>
	<li>check_cctv - Signal the Scheduler to run CCTV Checker</li>
	<li>check_news - Signal the Scheduler to run News Reader</li>
</ul>
<p>This file also holds all the paths and links that the program needs.</p>




<h3>THREAD: Scheduler</h3>
<p>Based off from - <a href="https://github.com/dbader/schedule">schedule</a> </p>
<p>The scheduler runs from the main method and controls objects of the following classes through the main method.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Show Downloader</li>
	<li>CCTV Checker</li>
	<li>News Reader</li>
</ul>
<p>The functions of the above objects and the time that they are required to run are programmed in to the scheduler.
	However, at the start of the program all functions are programmed to run once with a small time-delay between
	each. Each of the functions can also be executed by calling the relevant variable from the global variables list
	.</p>
<p>One of the interesting features about the scheduler is that, if by any chance there is already a function
	of the same class already running, it will put the function on a queue which will check to run again after 1
	minute of delay.</p>




<h3>THREADS: Communicators</h3>
<p>The file communicator.py in the communication folder contains a for loop which creates objects of the
	Communicator class and stores them in a dictionary with the account name as the key. Whenever a communication
	from a specific account is needed, the object can be called from the dictionary by looking for the account name
	in the keys. This is done by the following code snippet.</p>
<pre><code>telepot_channels = {}
for account in telegram_accounts:
    telepot_channels[account] = Communicator(account)</code></pre>
<p>If a message needs to be sent on any of these channels, it can be done by calling any of the below functions from
	anywhere on the code.</p>
<pre><code>communicator.send_message(telepot_account, chat_id, msg, image=False, keyboard=None, reply_to=None,
	caption="")</code></pre>
<pre><code>communicator.send_to_master(telepot_account, msg, image=False, keyboard=None, reply_to=None, caption="")</code></pre>
<pre><code>communicator.send_to_group(telepot_account, msg, group, image=False, caption="")</code></pre>
<p>Once the above objects are created the constructor of the object creates a thread which controls the
	communication for that account.</p>


<h3>CLASS: Communicator</h3>
<p>The communicator class is based off from <a href="https://telepot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html">telepot
</a> which enables me to use the telegram API. This class is one of the main classes of the entire program and hence
it is split into a base code which contains all the basic functions and the top level code which contains the main
interactions with the user.</p>

<h4>Telepot accounts and commands</h4>
<p>Using the BotFather on telegram, I created the following bots to manage my communications separately.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Main</li>
	<li>CCTV Images</li>
	<li>News</li>
	<li>Baby Activity Tracking</li>
	<li>Finance Activity Tracking</li>
</ul>
<p>The API keys for each of these bots are saved on a json so that the constructor is able to create an instance of
	telepot at the start.</p>
<p>This class is also connected to the mySQL database named "administration" which contain all the chat IDs that are
	allowed to communicate with the bot, the master chat ID who has administrative access and chat IDs that are
	subscribed for different group communications across the functions.</p>
<p>Once the telegram bot is initialized, the constructor automatically loads a JSON file with the same name as the
	channel from the commands' folder. This JSON files contains a list of all functions that should be accepted by
	this bot. The outer dictionary key refers to the command that is sent by the user. Each value contains another
	dictionary which contains the name of the function that needs to be called if the command is sent and the
	definition of the command to be sent to the user if asked for a list of commands. If the outer dictionary key
	does not start with a "/" it is considered as a heading for the next set of commands. This is useful to separate
	the commands out into groups when listing all the commands to the user.</p>
<pre><code>{
  "Administrative": false,
  "/alive": {
    "function": "alive",
    "definition": "Check bot"
  },
  "/time": {
    "function": "time",
    "definition": "Check bot time"
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Finally in the constructor of this class the telepot MessageLoop is initialized as a thread which contains both a
	handle function which handles the standard messages which come through the chat and a callback query function which
	handles all the queries which are returned through the in-line keyboards.</p>
